# Model_Resume-Parser
# Here, I have taken a dataset of 614 resumes and created json files out of them.
# Then, i have converted the files from json format into spacy format.(As the size of the spacy files are large,I couldn't keep them here)
# Next,I have trained the model for resume parser.
# Thank You for exploring :)
